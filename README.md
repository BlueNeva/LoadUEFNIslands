# Step By Step
1. Download both UEFN-MiddleMan.exe and UEFN-Islands.exe
2. Place UEFN-Islands.exe into your binaries folder
3. Open Fortnite, open the UEFN map you wish to use and exit fortnite upon entering the game
4. Open UEFN-MiddleMan.exe and under the UEFN Islands drop down select the latest ID based on the time and date (You can hold your right arrow key or select an ID to view the date and time of installation)
5. Ensure your Fortnite Path is correct
6. Press OK, your selected UEFN island will be added to your plugins folder under its own content folder (I.E ClassicRedVsBlue Content)
7. You're free to use these built versions of UEFN islands in your patched editor

8. Optionally, PIE should work by default if it has been previously installed, however, if it does not working pressing the tickmark next to "Use In PIE" may resolve your issues

# Secondary Disclaimer
This may be patched at a future date (Although unlikely) and is not going to be regularly maintained, this also only works on the matching versions of fortnite that the islands were downloaded from, they cannot be upgraded or downgraded, modified in any manner.
